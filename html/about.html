        <h1>Welcome to my site</h1>
        <p>This site was created following a course I took in Globalization and Sustainability. It presents the assignment content I wrote for the course as well as further musings. We hear ideas around this subject everywhere — it's easy to form opinions but not easy to form well-educated ones. The subject is so vast and multi-faceted that it's hard to attain a broad understanding and see how everything fit together. Well, this course provided for me exactly that. It addressed what globalization is and how it relates to climate change, the benefits and challenges, and what is sustainable prosperity. Through the course I learned a lot about the United Nations work and the 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). I now have a solid foundation on which the build further knowledge and insights.</p>
