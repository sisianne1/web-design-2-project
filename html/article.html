        <h1>How does globalization affect my daily life?</h1>
        <p>Globalization enables me to live the way I do. It is seen is the everyday objects around me: from what I eat, to what I use and what I enjoy. Every aspect of my life, from school and work to daily life and leisure is made possible because of the wide variety of products (and services) I can access. This is enabled by international trade and extensive transportation networks.</p>

                <h2>Lavandar flowers from Provence</h2>
                <img src="../images/lavander.jpg" alt="">
                <ol>
                    <li>Farmers in Provence grew and harvested the flowers</li>
                    <li>The company Plantes & Parfums in Provence makes and sells this product, which is marketed and exported to Canada</li>
                    <li>The product is transported to Canada by ship or plane and then by truck to the local retailer in Ottawa</li>
                    <li>The paper, cellophane and staples may be imported from other countries</li>
                    <li>The design of the packaging and the assembly of this product may have been outsourced</li>
                    <li>Can be considered a cultural good as lavender is associated with Provencal France</li>
                </ol>

                <h2>Artist's wooden mannequin</h2>
                <img src="../images/wooden-mannequin.jpg" alt="">
                <ol>
                    <li>The raw material wood is a downstream product of logging, which has led to deforestation and loss of biodiversity</li>
                    <li>The metal hardware used to attach the parts came from mining, which depletes the Earth's natural resources</li>
                    <li>Both logging and mining are global industries, and Canada is a major producer and exporter</li>
                    <li>Product manufacturing can be done in several stages in different countries depending on where cost is lowest</li>
                    <li>For example, the production of the wooden parts may be done in one country and then transported to another country for assembly</li>
                    <li>This keeps prices low for companies and consumers.</li>
                </ol>

                <h2>Kosher Taco Shells from B.C.</h2>
                <img src="../images/taco-shells.jpg" alt="">
                <ol>
                    <li>Taco shell is a Mexican food but this product is produced in B.C. and tacos is a popular food item for Canadians</li>
                    <li>The product is also marketed as Kosher, a Jewish concept. This is an import of cultural goods leading to (some) cultural convergence</li>
                    <li>The corn is likely domestically sourced as Canada produces a lot of corn</li>
                    <li>But other ingredients used (e.g. jalapeno, chili) are most likely imported</li>
                    <li>And the graphic design for the packaging and the production of the box may be outsourced or designed in Canada</li>
                </ol>

                <ol>
                    <li>Hewlett-Packard (HP) is an American company, but they can own production facilities anywhere in the world</li>
                    <li>The materials and parts are likely sourced from around the world, e.g. plastic shell and parts, metal print head, driver (software) to convert digital file into printer language</li>
                    <li>Hence, the manufacturing inputs come from global primary industries such as mineral and oil extraction and basic plastic/metal processing industries</li>
                    <li>The products is also exported to the rest of the world.</li>

                <h2>Photography book: <i>Private</i> by Mona Kuhn</h2>
                <img src="../images/photo-book.jpg" alt="">
                <ol>
                    <li>Kuhn, a German photographer, traveled to the Mojave Desert in California to photograph this series.</li>
                    <li>This is an example of international travel.</li>
                    <li>The book is a collaboration between many people: photographer, editor, publisher, writer, book designer, etc., possibly from different countries</li>
                    <li>The raw materials, paper and ink, may be sourced outside Germany</li>
                    <li>The product is distributed around the world, not only the physical book but also the cultural good (art).</li>
                </ol>
            </div>
        </div>

        <p>The everyday objects around me are the direct result of the exchange of goods and services between different countries. A product may be manufactured in Canada, but the raw materials are sourced elsewhere. Or the product may be manufactured elsewhere using some raw materials and/or parts from other countries, and then imported into Canada. There is a complex web of producers and manufacturers behind most of the products I use, and my way of life is heavily dependent on the people and the resources of the Earth.The world is intricately connected and is indeed a global village.</p>
